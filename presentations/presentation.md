## Area of intervention
My area of focus revolves around the intricate interplay between scent and memory: harnessing fragrances to evoke cherished memories, awaken deep emotions, and craft immersive sensory experiences that connect individuals to personally significant moments.

## Research Question
_How can olfactory experiences be crafted to evoke emotional memories and create rich, personalized atmospheres ?_

## Research

The idea that struck me the most was the area of scents so the first thing I did was to ask a lot of questions to smell and air.

![Scent - Questions](https://github.com/Psemata/softrobotics/blob/main/images/2024-11-06/smell-questions.png)

After, I searched references and images linked to smell to see where it could lead me.

<div align="center">

_"Substances that smell give off tiny molecules. Inhaling moves these molecules into your nose. There, special cells (olfactory receptors) detect these molecules. The receptors relay this information to your brain through your olfactory nerve and allow you to perceive smell."_

Finally, I listed all the keywords, feelings and details that came to mind when I thought about scents.

**There I had my "Eureka" ; The idea I liked so much was about the link between smells and emotions/memories : "La Madeleine de Proust"**

From this point on I mainly tried to develop the concepts I liked by chatting with ChatGPT, doodling stuff and elaborate ideas.

## Insights
- Smells are like a time travel machine ; scents have the unique power to evoke vivid memories and stir deep emotions, bridging past and present experiences.
- Each and everyone has their own scent landscape ; to me its the smell of old books and dust, for others it could be soap of ski wax

## First ideas & prototypes

### Childhood Alchemist
Childhood Alchemist is a soft, portable robot that invites you to explore and mix scents from a library to rediscover childhood fragrances. Each saved scent generates a unique, memory-infused story, blending aromas with personalized narratives.

#### Paper prototype

### The Artisan of Olfactive Silence
The Artisan of Olfactive Silence is a soft robot that senses fading scents left by residents, capturing the stillness with calming light patterns. It creates a tranquil, meditative atmosphere, like art inspired by absence.

### Archivist
The Archivist is a soft robot that tracks and records scent changes in cherished objects, like old books or wooden items, creating a digital olfactory diary. It alerts you to significant scent shifts and can emit selected scents for you to smell, with updates displayed on its back or app.

## Next Steps
My next steps would be to elaborate further my prototypes and define them from top to bottom :
- Define precise scenarios
- Elaborate the storytelling around them
- Precise the input and output
- Develop their design
