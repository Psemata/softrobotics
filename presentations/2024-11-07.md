## Area of intervention

My area of focus revolves around the intricate interplay between scent and memory: harnessing fragrances to evoke cherished memories, awaken deep emotions, and craft immersive sensory experiences that connect individuals to personally significant moments.

## Research Question

_How can olfactory experiences be crafted to evoke emotional memories and create rich, personalized atmospheres ?_

## Research

Multiples methods were used to research and delve deeper into the subject

### Questions

I asked questions to smells and to the air to deepen my understanding and to develop the aspects of the subject.

### Incompleteness

With this method, all the caracteristics that when through my mind were written.

### References

I also searched references and images linked to smell to see where it could lead me.

### Interviews

Interviews let me understand that each people have their own view on smell and to what it brings them ; emotions, memories or feelings.

### ChatGPT

I created a lot of different chats with the famous ChatGPT to generate ideas and views surrounding the link between scents and emotions or memories.

### Drawings

Finally for the prototype creation, I drew a series of sketches representing my results. This is where the link with animals or plants with the robots really came to life

## Insights

- Smells are like a time travel machine ; scents have the unique power to evoke vivid memories and stir deep emotions, bridging past and present experiences.
- Each and everyone has their own scent landscape ; to me its the smell of old books and dust, for others it could be soap of ski wax

## First ideas & prototypes

### Childhood Alchemist

Childhood Alchemist is a soft, portable robot that invites you to explore and mix scents from a library to rediscover childhood fragrances. Each saved scent generates a unique, memory-infused story, blending aromas with personalized narratives.

#### Paper prototype

#### Storyboard

### The Artisan of Olfactive Silence

The Artisan of Olfactive Silence is a soft robot that senses fading scents left by residents, capturing the stillness with calming light patterns. It creates a tranquil, meditative atmosphere, like art inspired by absence.

### Archivist

The Archivist is a soft robot that tracks and records scent changes in cherished objects, like old books or wooden items, creating a digital olfactory diary. It alerts you to significant scent shifts and can emit selected scents for you to smell, with updates displayed on its back or app.

## Next Steps

My next steps would be to elaborate further my prototypes and define them from top to bottom :

- Define precise scenarios
- Elaborate the storytelling around them
- Precise the input and output
- Develop their design
