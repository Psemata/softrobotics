## Area of intervention

My area of focus revolves around the intricate interplay between scent and memory: harnessing fragrances to evoke cherished memories, awaken deep emotions, and craft immersive sensory experiences that connect individuals to personally significant moments.

## Research Question

_How can olfactory experiences be crafted to evoke emotional memories and create rich, personalized atmospheres ?_

## Research

Multiples methods were used to research and delve deeper into the subject

### Questions

I asked questions to smells and to the air to deepen my understanding and to develop the aspects of the subject.

![Scent - Questions](https://github.com/Psemata/softrobotics/blob/main/images/2024-11-06/smell-questions.png)

This led me to question how smell works, how it is moving and the way it is influenced.

### Incompleteness

With this method, all the caracteristics that when through my mind were written.

![Scent - Incompleteness](https://github.com/Psemata/softrobotics/blob/main/images/2024-11-06/smell-incompleteness.png)

The link between emotion and scent became clear and interested me. Some peculiar smells are strongly linked to our emotions and feelings.

### References

I also searched references and images linked to smell to see where it could lead me.

Although it mainly helped me to put images on my words.

### Interviews

Interviews let me understand that each people have their own view on smell and to what it brings them ; emotions, memories or feelings.

#### Fiona

_"I can say that when I smelled it (it was the scent of gnocco fritto, pizza, or for example her morel sauce) upon arriving at my grandma's, I would head straight to the kitchen to greet her and help her if she needed it. It made me happy. I was curious to watch her cook and to help, and I looked forward to enjoying the meal with the family, sharing moments of warmth and conviviality."_

#### Dad

_"Yes, the smell of hay drying!
I like it, and it brings back memories of my childhood!
I don’t particularly seek it out, but when I’m walking through the fields and catch that smell, I immediately go back in time !"_

#### Pedro

_"Well, I love the smell of pine because it reminds me of vacations. I smell it when I’m on the Mediterranean coasts, duh, so not that often. I don’t specifically look for it; it’s just nice when it happens."_

#### Arno

_"The smell of wax for prepping skis.
Joy, because it means I’m going skiing soon. It’s relatively frequent (in winter), but the emotion is strongest when I’m prepping my skis for the first time of the season (which should happen in the coming weeks).
It takes me back to when I was around 12-13-14, when my grandfather taught me how to prepare my gear for winter."_

#### Benjamin

_"For me, there are certain floral soaps (sorry, I can’t be more specific).
Nostalgia, joy.
Sometimes when washing my hands, several times a day when I have that particular one.
It reminds me of certain video games I used to binge. I really associate them with smells like that, as they would seep into the game controller._

This finally linked the scent, the emotions and the memories.

### ChatGPT

I created a lot of different chats with the famous ChatGPT to generate ideas and views surrounding the link between scents and emotions or memories.

It helped me establish my multiple more clearly in word.

### Drawings

Finally for the prototype creation, I drew a series of sketches representing my results. This is where the link with animals or plants with the robots really came to life

## Insights

- Smells are like a time travel machine ; scents have the unique power to evoke vivid memories and stir deep emotions, bridging past and present experiences.
- Each and everyone has their own scent landscape ; to me its the smell of old books and dust, for others it could be soap of ski wax

## First ideas & prototypes

### Childhood Alchemist

Childhood Alchemist is a soft, portable robot that invites you to explore and mix scents from a library to rediscover childhood fragrances. Each saved scent generates a unique, memory-infused story, blending aromas with personalized narratives.

#### Paper prototype

### The Artisan of Olfactive Silence

The Artisan of Olfactive Silence is a soft robot that senses fading scents left by residents, capturing the stillness with calming light patterns. It creates a tranquil, meditative atmosphere, like art inspired by absence.

### Archivist

The Archivist is a soft robot that tracks and records scent changes in cherished objects, like old books or wooden items, creating a digital olfactory diary. It alerts you to significant scent shifts and can emit selected scents for you to smell, with updates displayed on its back or app.

## Next Steps

My next steps would be to elaborate further my prototypes and define them from top to bottom :

- Define precise scenarios
- Elaborate the storytelling around them
- Precise the input and output
- Develop their design
